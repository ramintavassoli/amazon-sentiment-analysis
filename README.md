# amazon-sentiment-analysis
The goal of this competition was to predict app star rating based on app review. The training data comprised of reviews collected from Amazon App store with multiple other features derived from app and review metadata. I used a python package Pattern to quantify the sentiments of one-gram comparative and superlative adjectives. Using this method, I assigned a score to each review and ran a 5 bucket k-means clustering on the scores. The test reviews that fell into the highest scoring bucket were associated with 5 star ratings. I learned how to use bigrams in sentiment analysis in the aftermath and believe incorporating bigram analysis would have significantly lowered my overall error.
